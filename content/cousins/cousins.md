Summary: Vacation with my Cousin Tommy in Southern New Jersey and Manhattan

# Reunion Kick-off at Camp Kruza #

Coronageddon quarantine did me a solid. It helped reunite me with my fellow Star-Trek-loving, musical, writer geek New Jersey second cousin Tommy Ranisekski. We had last seen each other in 1989 when my grandma Laura and I had visited Philidelphia. The cousins' reunion started with chit-chat over the adventures and misadventures of the last few decades of our lives. The reunion moved to Facetime, then finally, to my childhood home and parent's current slice of paradise in Clearwater, complete with pool, surf and turf, drinks, and backyard patio with neon signs, and Pandora playing a constant stream of classic rock, pop, and Jimmy Buffett tunes. Tommy's brother Louie joined us since he lives less than an hour from my folks, and I in my family-tree fecklessness, at first mistook him for his son. Oh well, there's a few "Louie's" in their family... but with a sunny Florida February day, I couldn't exactly blame it on bad lighting. Roxy joined us, too, and my folks and cousins reminisced over the old days in Phildephia, PA and Wildwood, NJ. I mostly listened and enjoyed. But we all celebrated the reunion and finished a fine three-hour picnic feeling, full, happy, and feeling loved... because we were all three.

We spent our first full day of our reunion in Cape May, with it's quaint but crazy expensive homes, which Tommy was lucky at one point to own.
